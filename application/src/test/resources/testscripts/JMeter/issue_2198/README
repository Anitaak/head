create_loan_only.jmx
    Create many loans. No bootstrapping--relies on certain data being present.
    Adjust global variables in "Test Plan" and "HTTP Request Defaults"
    according to the database used during testing.

load.jmx
    (incomplete) Bootstraps itself by adding fixture data necessary to run load
    tests.

NOTE: the create_loan_only.jmx script references conversion.js that has now been
removed (Feb 4, 2010) so it may not work now.
