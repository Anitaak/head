Notes on generating test cases.

5/5/08
Created loan-repayment-master-generator-2008-05-05.xls from Ofer's latest spreadsheet
that he mailed out on 5/5 and named loan-repayment-master-fees2.xls

The generator now accommodates all combinations of grace period types and fee types.

See worksheet "testCaseData" for the expected layout of test case output from AllPairs.
