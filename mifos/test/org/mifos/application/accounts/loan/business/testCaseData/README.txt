Notes on generating test cases.

5/5/08
Created loan-repayment-master-generator-2008-05-05.xls from Ofer's latest spreadsheet
that he mailed out on 5/5 and named loan-repayment-master-fees2.xls

The generator now accommodates all combinations of grace period types and fee types.

See worksheet "testCaseData" for the expected layout of test case output from AllPairs.

Test sets:

Each set has a variant that is parameterized by
* Generator version date
* declining or flat loan type
* grace parameters, including none
* fee parameters
* penalty parameters

File naming convention
input{-variants}-set<n>.txt -- tab-delimited file input to allPairs
output{-variants}-set<n>.txt -- tab-delimited output from allPairs
testcase{-variants}-set<n>.<m>.csv -- tab-delimited case generated by the generator
	applied to row <m> of allPairs output
	
Example:
	input-2008-05-05-flat-grace-set1.txt
	output-2008-05-05-flat-grace-set1.txt
	testcase-2008-05-05-flat-grace-set1.2.csv

Set 1: 
8 combinations of configurations, including all variants (except penalties so far)
2005-05-05-(flat|declining)[-grace][-fees][-penalties].set1
