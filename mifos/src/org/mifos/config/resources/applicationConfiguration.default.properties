# An initial properties based configuration file for default values.

# This file will ship with Mifos in the WAR file and contain default
# configuration values that should not be modified by an MFI during
# Mifos deployment. To customize the values in this file a separate
# file containing only those values to be changed should be put on
# the class path. This file containing override values must be named
# "applicationConfiguration.custom.properties" (as defined in the file
# "configurationFactory.xml").
