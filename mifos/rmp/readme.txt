This directory contains a version of the Reports Mini Portal (RMP).
Turning this into something which can be built and run is
currently a fairly manual process.

The directories conf, lib, sql, src, and test correspond to the
corresponding directories in the main mifos directory.  Some
of the files, just to pick an example ReportsBO,
are duplicated in the main directory (I think
the ones here are newer?).

The file RMP-Changes.txt describes changes to be made to the
mifos code (outside reports as such).

The actual jaspar report definitions are at
