<h2>Microfinance – Fighting Global Poverty </h2>
<p>Microfinance is often considered the most effective strategy in the fight against
global poverty. Loans as little as fifty dollars are life-changing for the world’s
poorest people by giving them the means to buy an animal, tool, or other asset to
start or expand their business. Its importance is recognized worldwide, as 2005
was pronounced by the United Nations as the ‘International Year of Microcredit’.
However, despite the tremendous impact microfinance has had on families and
communities to date, it has reached just a fraction of the poorest people in need
of financial services. One primary reason has been the lack of a flexible, costeffective
technology infrastructure to support microfinance institutions (MFIs), the
organizations that provide financial services to the poor around the world.</p>

<h2> The Mifos Product</h2>
<p>Mifos is an open source software platform for MFIs to manage their clients,
portfolio and reporting needs. It was initiated by Grameen Foundation USA’s
Technology Center, established to pioneer technology-based solutions for the
microfinance industry.<br />
Mifos’ unique design solves a major challenge facing the industry today. Each
MFI operates in a unique environment with different legal and operational needs
that must be reflected in its information system. Yet today, MFIs must choose
between packaged solutions, which may not have the flexibility to adapt to their
needs, or an expensive custom-built solution. MFIs are continually reinventing
the wheel as they spend scarce resources developing custom systems.
Capitalizing on the open source framework to establish local support and
developer networks, Mifos provides flexibility and a low total cost of ownership.
</p>

<h2>How to get involved </h2>
<p>We invite technical volunteers to contribute to the Mifos project as part of the
Mifos Community. Many opportunities exist including code reviews, feature
scoping and feature development. If you are an experienced Java developer
and/or have a background in microfinance systems and would like to be part of
the Mifos Community, please visit our <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Javatools/MIFOSHowToHelp"> Getting Started page</a> or send an email to mifos-volunteers@lists.sourceforge.net. 
Thank you!
